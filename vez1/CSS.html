        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language
        used for describing the look and formatting of a
        document written in a markup language. While most often
        used to change the style of web pages and user
        interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can
        be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain
        XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS
        is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to
        create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for
        web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile
        applications.

        CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of
        document content from document presentation, including
        elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This
        separation can improve content accessibility, provide
        more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
        CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and
        repetition in the structural content, such as semantically
        insignificant tables that were widely used to format pages
        before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major
        browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation
        instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or
        style section of the HTML file. For each matching HTML
        element, it provides a list of formatting instructions.
        For example, a CSS rule might specify that "all heading
        1 elements should be bold," leaving pure semantic HTML
        markup that asserts "this text is a level 1 heading"
        without formatting code such as a  <mark>&lt;bold&gt;</mark> tag indicating
        how such text should be displayed.

        <h2> Selectors </h2>   
        
        In CSS, selectors are used to declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
        Selectors may apply to:
        <ol>
            <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second level headers h2</li>
            <li>
                elements specified by attribute, in particular:
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li>id: an identifier unique to the document</li>
                <li>class: an identifier that groups multiple elements in a document</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
