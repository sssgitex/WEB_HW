    </h1>

    <p>
        JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language.
        It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose
        implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with
        the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously,
        and alter the document content that is displayed. It is also
        used in server-side network programming with runtime
        environments such as Node.js, game development and the
        creation of desktop and mobile applications. With the rise
        of the single-page web app and JavaScript-heavy sites,
        it is increasingly being used as a compile target for
        source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and
        static languages. In particular, Emscripten and highly
        optimised JIT compilers, in tandem with asm.js which is
        friendly to AOT compilers like OdinMonkey, have enabled C
        and C++ programs to be compiled into JavaScript and execute
        at near-native speeds, making JavaScript be considered the
        "assembly language of the web", according to its creator and
        others.

    <p>
        JavaScript is classified as a prototype-based scripting language
        with dynamic typing and first-class functions. This mix of
        features makes it a multi-paradigm language, supporting
        object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming
        styles.

    <p>
        <dl style="text-indent: 5%; font-family:'Consolas'">
            <dt>function factorial(n) {</dt>
                <dd>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>if (n === 0) {</dt>
                            <dd>return 1;</dd>
                        <dt>}</dt>
                        <dt>return n * factorial(n - 1);</dt>
                    </dl>
